    <p>Target 1:</p>
    <p>BDRP</p>
    <p>Reason: They are corrupted. They give admin to people for doing small things and they think that it's not their problem when they raid them.</p>
    <p>Weak points: You can do small tasks and tell them that you need a higher role for it and they will give it</p>
    <a href="https://discord.gg/bdrpeh" target="_blank"><button>Join BDRP</button></a>
    <p>Target 2:</p>
    <p>President RP</p>
    <p>Reason: Banned me 2 times and no one got punished for AA and I think he got promoted too</p>
    <p>Weak points: The owner is like 5 so he will give you admin</p>
